# Env for configuring our benchmarking process
# ==========================================

# Scratch Space Configuration
# NOTE: It's your responsibility to ensure that the scratch space is large enough to hold the files you want to test.
#       Make sure the calling user has read/write access to the scratch space.
# ==========================

# Bench Path: Where to store benchmarking scratch space on target system
export BENCH_PATH=bench
# Test Path: Where to store test files on target system
export INPUT_PATH=$BENCH_PATH/input
# Packed Path: Where to store packed files on target system
export PACKED_PATH=$BENCH_PATH/packed
# Unpacked Path: Where to store unpacked files on target system
export UNPACKED_PATH=$BENCH_PATH/unpacked
# Manifest Path: Where to store manifest files on target system
export MANIFEST_PATH=$BENCH_PATH/manifest
# Results Path: Where to store results files on target system
export RESULT_PATH=$BENCH_PATH/result

# IFTTT Configuration
# This is used to send notifications to IFTTT when the benchmarking process is complete.
# ===================

# IFTTT Key - key for managing test notifications
export IFTTT_TEST_WEBHOOK_KEY=""

# Test Parameters Configuration
# These parameters are used to configure the test. You can change them to suit your needs.
# Remember to configure the scratch space to be large enough to hold the files you want to test.
# Remember to put thought into your target size and maximum width/depth.
