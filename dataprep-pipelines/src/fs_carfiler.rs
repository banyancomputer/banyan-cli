// DEPRECATED until need / design for CAR filing is determined

// Note (laudiacay): i think i'm willing to bet that the way people wanna make a car file is "put as large a subtree as you can into each one"
// so we're gonna start at the leftmost node. we're gonna try and get as many of its siblings as we can.
// if we succeed we're gonna go up a node. and get as many of its siblings as we can.
// this is... hard.
